Main concepts

1) Forecast - a user guess for the weather (the forecast is applicable at least 1 day before the goal-date
 and is matched upon the weather in that goal-date)
 Forecast consists of
  1.1. temperature (temperatureForecast)
  1.2. precipitation (precipitationForecast)
  1.3. sky (skyForecast)
  1.4. humidity (humidityForecast)

2) Reality - same as forecast, but related to the actual weather

3) Game - a single forecast

4) The comparison between Forecast and Reality is implemented by the relevant type class instances

5) REST endpoints:
        GET:
            /user/{login}/games - get all user's games
            /user/{login}/{game-id} - get user's specific games (is it so needed???)
            /raiting
           external:
            get weather by location (WIP)
        POST:
            /user/{game-id}
        DELETE:
            /user/{game-id}
